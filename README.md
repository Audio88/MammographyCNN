# MammographyCNN

This project is a computer vision project that diagnosis breast cancer through computer vision. It uses mammograms or x-rays as a data, and convolutional neural networks to decide if the mammogram is cancerous. Because convolutional neural networks are considered a black box. I used sailency heat maps, a visualization technique that tells us which pixels in our mammogram are most important for classifying an image as cancerous.
